# Hardhat Thoughts

The purpose of this repo is very simple:

- **To allow anyone to create their own `Thoughts` smart contract and share whatever they would like to the blockchain**

Think of this as a digital store where you can get your own "immutable diary" for free

_all you have to do is pay for the gas to deploy it_
